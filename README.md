# Take 2 Chrome Extension

The Take 2 Chrome extension is part of an MVP for Call For Code (Emb-race). This extension is a method for crowdsourcing racially biased words and phrases in the media so that they can be used to train and improve a machine learning model to detect racial bias in content. 

Our hope for the future is that this is a step towards a media culture that is free of racial bias and toxic racism, further we hope it will eliminate the reinforced racism that can be created through racially biased media content. We hope you will help us in this community effort:

- As a content contributor to enrich our data by installing the extension and using it.
- As a developer to help us improve the extension design and functionality to accelerate this project forward.


This extension uses the [Highlighter chrome extension](https://github.com/jeromepl/highlighter) library as a basis in order to allow the highlighter functionality for selecting text. 


## Start contributing to this project

The following steps will explain how to get started with contributing to our crowdsourced dataset of racially biased text. 


### 1. Install the Take 2 chrome extension

You will need the chrome browser, which can be installed [here](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjer4BRCZARIsABK4QeVAQkotXkLJlBvJS2V7R2q9__Gk3PchSyhorcBNAZXx7JJwbDeRrBYaAk3TEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). 

In the future we hope this extension will be available via the chrome store, however for now you will need to install from a local directory. 

- Clone this git repo. 
- In order to install the chrome plugin, navigate to `chrome://extensions` and then select the **load unpacked** option. 
- Navigate to the repo folder and `select`. You will now have the browser plug-in available to you. 

### 2. Highlight text

When in webpage content where you find racially biased words or phrases that are not already highlighted, highlight and categorise them as follows:

- click on the plugin icon in the top right Chrome toolbar. 
- 'Toggle cursor' to enter highlight mode, your pointer will show as a highlighter pen.
- Highlight the word or phrase, by pressing the left mouse button, and moving along the text.
- Once highlighted a bar showing the categorisations will appear, select the appropriate category.
- To turn off highlight mode, click on the plugin icon and 'Toggle Cursor'.
